#               character string beginning with "MSGQ_".
#               The following are forbidden because they are reserved.
#               "MSGQ_NULL", "MSGQ_TOP", "MSGQ_END"
#
#   n_size:     The number of bytes (8 or more and 512 or less)
#               of each element of the normal priority queue.
#               Specify fixed header length (8 bytes) + parameter length
#               as a multiple of 4.
#               In the case of a shared queue, it is rounded up to the value
#               of a multiple of 64 in the tool.
#
#   n_num:      Number of elements of the normal priority queue
#               (1 or more and 16384 or less).
#
#   h_size:     Number of bytes (0 or 8 to 512 inclusive) for each element
#               of the high priority queue.
#               Specify 0 when not in use.

#               Specify 0 when not in use.

#               in spl_layout.conf.
